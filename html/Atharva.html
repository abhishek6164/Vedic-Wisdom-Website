        <p> <span> The Veda of the Atharvanis the Atharvaveda.</span> Atharvan denotes directions and mantras especially
            in connection
            to ward off evil and hardship and also contains philosophical thoughts. ‘Atharvan‘ originally means ‘priest’
            and the Mantras in the Atharvaveda-Samhita were brought to light by Rishi Atharva. <br><br>

            <span> According </span> the etymology of the Nirukta, Atharvan is the name given to a stable-minded person
            who is
            immovably firm i.e., Yogi. The oldest name, however, by which this Veda is known in Indian literature is
            ‘Atharvangirasa-Veda’, that is the ‘Veda of the Atharvans and the Angiras’. Angiras too were a group of
            schools and priests. <br><br>

            <span> According to Patanjali,</span> Atharvaveda had nine Shakhas, but the Samhita of the Atharvaveda is
            today available
            only in two rescensions – the Shaunaka and the Paippalada. It is the Shaunaka-Samhita that is frequently
            meant when the Atharvaveda is mentioned in ancient and modern literature. It is a collection of 730 hymns
            containing 5987 Mantras, divided into 20 books (Kandas). Some 1200 verses are derived from the Rigveda.
            About one sixth of the text of the Atharvaveda including two entire books (15 and 16) is written in prose,
            similar in style and language to the Brahmanas, the best of the text is in poetic verses.</p><br><br>

        <p>
            <span> Some </span>traditions prescribe that this Veda should be known as Brahma Ritvik who used to
            supervise the process
            of Yaga or sacrifice. In sacrificial ceremonies he was supposed to know all the three Vedas, but usually he
            used to represent the Atharvaveda. Due to his association, the Atharvaveda is also named ‘Brahmaveda‘, the
            Veda of Brahma priest.</p><br><br>

        <p> <span> The </span>Atharvaveda is the oldest literary monument of Indian medicine. It is believed to be the
            origin of
            Ayurveda, the Indian science of medicine. There are a series of Mantras related to cure various physical and
            mental diseases. Another class of hymns includes prayers for protection from the bite of snakes or injurious
            insects. We find mention and application of medicines and medicinal herbs. This feature distinguishes the
            Atharvaveda from the rest of the Vedas.<br><br>

            <span> Philosophical</span> portions of this Samhita present a fairly high development of metaphysical
            thought. The chief
            ideas of the Upanishads, the conception of a highest god as creator and preserver of the world (Prajapati),
            and even the ideas of an impersonal creative principle, besides a number of philosophical terms such as
            Brahman, Tapas, Asat, Prana, Manas must have been the common property of large circles – at the time when
            these hymns originated. Therefore, the study of the philosophical ideas, revealed in the Atharvaveda, is
            important to understand the development of Indian Philosophical thought.<br><br>

            <span> Atharvaveda</span> is the only Veda which is related to both worldly happiness and spiritual
            knowledge. Vedic
            commentator Sayana has praised this for fulfilling both ends – this world and the other world. Thus, it
            appears to be an interesting text for a general reader of the Vedic literature.</p><br><br>

        <h3>Content:</h3><br>
        <p> <span> The Atharvaveda</span> is looked upon as the Veda of varied knowledge. It contains numerous Mantras,
            which according
            to their subject-matter, can be broadly divided into three categories: <br> 1. Related to the cure of
            diseases
            and destruction of adverse forces. <br> 2. Related to establish peace, protection, health, wealth,
            friendship and
            long life. <br> 3. Related to the nature of Supreme Reality, time, death and immortality.<br><br>

            <span> Bloomfield has divided</span> the subject of Atharvaveda into many categories, such as Bhashijya,
            Paushtika,
            Prayashctta, Rajakarma, Strikarma,Darshana, Kuntapa etc. Here some Important and famous Suktas of
            Atharvaveda are listed to have a general view its subject:</p><br><br>
