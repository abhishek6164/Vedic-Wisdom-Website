        <h3> 1. Nature and Importance:</h3><br>
        <p> In its character Yajurveda is quite different from the Rigveda & Samaveda Samhitas. It is principally in
            prose form. The word ‘Yajush‘ in the Yajurveda is explained variously. But one of its definitions says –

            ‘Gadyatmakam yajuh’. <br><br>
            <span>
                A ‘Yajuh’ is that which</span> is in prose form’. Another definition – ‘Yajur Yajateh’ talks about its
            relation
            with the sacrifice (Yajna) because both the terms are derived from the root. ‘Yaj ‘. <br><br>

            <span> The Yajurveda is more pronouncedly </span>a ritual Veda for it is essentially a guide-book for the
            Adhvaryu priest
            who had to do practically all ritualistic works in a sacrifice. His works vary from the selection of a plot
            of land for the sacrificial altar down to offering oblations to the sacred fires. Just as the
            Samaveda-Samhita is the song-book of the Udgata priest, so the Yajurveda-Samhitas are the prayer-books for
            the Adhvaryu priest. It is solely meant for the purposes of sacrificial <br>

            <span>
                The Yajurveda</span> is also important for its presentation of philosophical doctrines. It preaches the
            concept of
            Prana and Manas also. Many times, it is quoted for depicting religious and social life of the Vedic people.
            It is also known for giving certain geographical data.

            <p>A page from the Vajasneyi samhita found in the Shukla Yajurveda (Sanskrit, Devanagari script). This
                version of the manuscript opens with salutations to Ganesha and Sadashiva (Shaivism).</p>

        <h3> 2. Division and Samhitas:</h3> <br>
        <p> The Yajurveda is two-fold-<br><br>

            1.The White (or Pure) Yajurveda.<br>
            2.The Black (or Dark) Yajurveda.

            <br><br>

            <span> The Krishna Yajurveda</span> is characterised by mixture of mantra and brahmana whereas the Shukla
            Yajurveda
            maintains the clear separation of the two. The Shukla Yajurveda is related with the Aditya-school and the
            Krishna Yajurveda is related with the Brahma-school. <br>
            <span> In the beginning</span> of his commentary on the
            Shukla-Yajurveda Samhita, a story is given by Mahidhara, about the two-fold division of the Yajurveda. Rishi
            Vaishampayana taught the Yajurveda to Rishi Yajyavalkya and other pupils. Once Vaishampayana got angry with
            Yajyavalkya and asked him to give back what he had learnt. <br>
            <span> Yajyavalkya vomited </span>the Veda by the power of
            Yoga, while the other pupils at the command of his teacher swallowed up the Yajush thus vomited, assuming
            the form of birds called Tittiri. <br>
            <span> Thus, the Yajush </span>became dark and was named Kishna or Taittiriya. Then
            Yajyavalkya prayed to the Sun, who came to him in the form of a horse i.e. Vaji ) and gave him back the
            Yajush. Hence this Yajurveda was named Shukla or Vajasaneyi. <br><br>

            Sukla Yajurveda has two Samhita available today:

            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Madhyandina Samhita</li>
                <li>Kanva Samhtia</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Krishna Yajurveda has four Sanhitas available today:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Taittiriya Samhita</li>
                <li>Kathaka Samhita</li>
                <li>Kapishthala Samhita</li>
                <li>Maitrayani Samhita</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <br><br>
        <h3> 3. Contents :</h3>

        <p> <span> We find detailed description</span> of sacrifices in the Samhita of Yajurveda. The Vajasaneyi-Samhita
            gives a vivid description of many important sacrifices such as – Darsha-purnamasa, Agnihotra, Somayaga,
            Chaturmasya, Agnihotra, Vajapeya, Ashvamedha, Sarva-medha, Brahma-yajya, Pitrimedha, Sautramani, and so on.
            For a general idea the contents can be divided into three sections. The first section comprises the
            Darshapurnamasa, the second section deals with the Somayaga and the third section comprises the Agnicayanas.
            The last section of the Vajasaneyi-Samhita contains the popular Ishavasya-Upanishad. <br><br> <span> It is
                important</span> to know that the first eighteen Adhyayas of the Vajasaneyi- Samhita are completely
            given, word for word, and explained in the Shatapatha Brahmana of the white Yajurveda. On the basis of this
            point few scholars think that the last sections of this Samhita are of a later date.</p>
