        <h1>The Vedas</h1>
        <img src="/images/Atharva.png" style="margin-inline-end: 30px;" alt="">
        <p> <span class="space"> <b> The Vedas</b> </span>are the religious texts which inform the religion of
            Hinduism
            (also known as Sanatan
            Dharma meaning “Eternal Order” or “Eternal Path”). The term veda means “knowledge” in that they are
            thought
            to contain the fundamental knowledge relating to the underlying cause of, function of, and personal
            response
            to existence.</p>
        <br>

        <p> <span class="space"> They</span> are considered among the oldest, if not the oldest, religious works in
            the
            world. They are commonly
            referred to as “scripture”, which is accurate in that they can be defined as holy writ concerning the
            nature
            of the Divine. Unlike the scriptures of other religions, however, the Vedas are not thought to have been
            revealed to a certain person or persons at a specific historical moment; they are believed to have
            always
            existed and were apprehended by sages in deep meditative states at some point prior to c. 1500 BCE but
            precisely when is unknown.</p><br>

        <p> <span class="space"> The Vedas</span> existed in oral form and were passed down from master to student
            for
            generations until they were
            committed to writing between c. 1500 - c. 500 BCE (the so-called Vedic Period) in India. They were
            carefully
            preserved orally as masters would have students memorize them forwards and backwards with emphasis on
            exact
            pronunciation in order to keep what was originally heard intact.</p><br>

        <p><span class="space"> The Vedas</span> are therefore regarded as Shruti in Hinduism meaning “what is
            heard” as
            contrasted with other texts
            designated Smritis (“what is remembered”), accounts of great heroes and their struggles in works such as
            the
            Mahabharata, Ramayana, and Bhagavad Gita (although some sects of Hinduism regard the Bhagavad Gita as
            Shruti). The texts which make up the Four Vedas are:</p>

        <p> Orthodox Hindu denominations recognize the Vedas as a significant spiritual authority but not all Hindu
            sects
            follow suit. Reform movements throughout the modern era, beginning in the 19th century CE, place greater
            value on personal religious experience than scriptural authority and tradition and so some sects, or
            off-shoots of Hinduism (such as the Brahmos Movement) reject the Vedas entirely as superstition. Even
            so,
            the works continue to be recited, studied, and venerated in the present and remain an important part of
            Hindu religious observances, festivals, and ceremonies.</p>

                    <span class="space"> No one</span> knows the origin of the Vedas although
                    many scholars and theologians have advanced differing claims on the subject. It is most commonly
                    believed (though by no
                    means universally accepted) that the Vedic vision came to India by way of nomadic Aryan tribes
                    who migrated there from Central Asia sometime around the 3rd millennium BCE. “Aryan” should
                    be understood as it was by the people of the time, meaning “free” or “noble”, a class of
                    people, not a race, and not Caucasian (as was claimed by 18th- and 19th-century CE Western
                    scholars).
                    These do-Aryans are thought to have broken off from a larger group which also included the
                    Indo-Iranians who settled in the region of modern-day Iran and came to be known in the West (via
                    the
                    Greeks) as Persians. Similarities between Early Iranian Religion (and later Zoroastrianism) and
                    early Hinduism suggest a common belief system, which then developed separately.

                    <br><br>

                    The Indo-Aryan Migration theory holds that the Vedic vision was
                    developed
                    in
                    Central Asia
                    and brought to India during the decline of the indigenous Harappan Civilization (c.
                    7000-600
                    BCE) between c.
                    2000-1500 BCE, merging that culture's beliefs with their own. Another theory, however,
                    known
                    as
                    Out
                    of India (OIT) claims that the Harappan Civilization had already developed this vision
                    and
                    exported
                    it from India to Central Asia from whence it then returned with the migration of the
                    Indo-Aryans.

                    There are sound reasons for recognizing the motivation, at least, for
                    either
                    claim (though the
                    OIT is rejected by mainstream academia) and scholars seem to hold to one or the other
                    more
                    for
                    personal reasons than any based on objective, scholarly research. The most reasonable
                    response
                    to the question of the origin and dating of the Vedas is simply that one does not know.
                    The
                    human need to resolve what appears to be mysterious, however, keeps the debate alive in
                    the
                    present day. Scholars Hermann Kulke and Dietmar Rothermund comment briefly on the early
                    development of the dating/origin issue:

                    era in which the Vedas

                    but this has nothing to do with the age of the concepts or the oral traditions themselves.
                    The designation “Vedic Period” is a modern construct, which relies on evidence of an
                    Indo-Aryan migration, which, as noted, is not universally accepted. Even so, that is the theory
                    most commonly accepted as historically accurate based on the available evidence. The development
                    of
                    the texts is described by scholar John M. Koller.

                    belief structure which involved ritual bathing and some form of worship service. The only clear
                    evidence of religious belief and practice comes from statuary of the nature spirits known as
                    yakshas
                    which
                    date
                    to before c. 3000 BCE in rudimentary form and continue, with greater refinement, through

                    Brahma
                    (the

                    the
                    suffering and loss one experienced in the physical world. Once an individual had broken

                    from
                    the
                    traditional form, which seemed to have been corrupted by outside influences. This
                    reimagining
                    included a rejection of scriptural authority and the stature of the Vedas declined. The
                    Brahmos
                    Movement, in fact, rejected the Vedas entirely as superstitious nonsense and focused on
                    a
                    personal
                    experience with the Divine which was actually quite similar to the theological focus of
                    both
                    Protestant Christianity and the earlier Hindu Bhakti Movement of the Middle Ages .

                    <span class="space"> Any</span> Hindu sect or movement in the present day
                    which
                    rejects
                    the
                    Vedas
                    takes
                    its basic platform
                    from
                    the 19th- and early 20th-century CE efforts such as Brahmos. Orthodox Hindus continue to
                    regard
                    the
                    Vedas as highly as in the past, however, and the works continue to be chanted and sung
                    by
                    those
                    who
                    still recognize in them the mystery of an inexpressible truth offered without easy
                    explanation
                    which
                    can be experienced without having to be understood.
